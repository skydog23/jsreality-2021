# jReality JavaScript Port

This is a JavaScript port of jReality, a Java-based 3D visualization library.

## Overview

This project aims to port the core functionality of jReality to JavaScript, making it accessible for web-based 3D visualization applications.

## Original Project

This is a port of the jReality project, which can be found in the adjacent jsreality-2021 directory. The original Java project remains unchanged, and this port focuses on creating a JavaScript implementation of its core features.

## Status

This project is currently under development. More details about specific features and implementation progress will be added as the port progresses.

## Structure

The project maintains a similar structure to the original jReality where appropriate, while adapting to JavaScript conventions and web-based requirements.

## Development

More information about development setup, building, and testing will be added as the project evolves.
