# Outstanding Issues

1. **Alpha slider collapses while dragging**  
   - *Status*: Open  
   - *Description*: The ColorPicker alpha slider popup hides itself as soon as the user drags the slider thumb. Hover-only visibility and focus handling are still unstable even after adding pointer-capture hooks.  
   - *Next Steps*: Revisit hover/popup interaction. Consider keeping the slider visible while pointer capture is active, or move the slider into a persistent inline layout.
